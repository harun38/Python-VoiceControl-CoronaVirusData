# Python-VoiceControl-CoronaVirusData

This python voice recognition project. I used ParseHub which is very useful for taking data from web.
When you say for example "how many total cases In Canada" it firstly print the result,
then speak the result. Be sure your microfon setting is okay and do not forget the imports.
